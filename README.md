## üîß Development Approach

AuroraMax follows a sophisticated 4-phase iterative development process:

1. **Phase 1: Seven Init Variants** - Specialized variants exploring different philosophies
2. **Phase 2: Synthesis I** - Merge best features into SemiFinal variant
3. **Phase 3: LLM Refinement** - AI-driven analysis and enhancement
4. **Phase 4: Release Candidate** - Final synthesis and optimization

Currently implementing the **Init-General-Minimal** variant as the foundation.

## üì¶ Installation

### Method 1: Rebase from Existing Atomic Desktop
