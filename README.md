### Modifying the Image

1. **Fork this repository**
2. **Edit configuration files**:
   - `recipe.yml`: Package list and modules
   - `files/`: Custom system files
   - `Containerfile`: Advanced build customization

3. **Build locally** (optional):
   ```bash
   ./build-auroramax.sh
   ```

4. **Push changes** to trigger automated builds

### Adding Packages

Edit `recipe.yml` and add packages to the appropriate section:

```yaml
# For RPM packages
rpm:
  install:
    - package-name

# For Flatpak applications  
default-flatpaks:
  notify: true
  install:
    - com.example.Application
```

### Custom System Files

Place files in the `files/` directory matching the filesystem hierarchy:
- `files/etc/`: System configuration
- `files/usr/`: System binaries and data
- `files/home/`: Default user configurations

## üöÄ Development

### Local Building

```bash
# Quick build script
./build-auroramax.sh

# Manual build with Podman
podman build -t auroramax-gamehack:test .

# Test in container
podman run -it --rm auroramax-gamehack:test bash
```

### CI/CD Pipeline

The project uses GitHub Actions for automated builds:
- **Triggers**: Push to main, PRs, tags, manual dispatch
- **Schedule**: Nightly builds at 00:00 UTC
- **Outputs**: Container images pushed to GitHub Container Registry
- **Signing**: All images are signed with cosign for verification
