AuroraMax Linux - Gaming / Hacking Distro ‚Äì Universal Blue Atomic Image Specification AuroraMax Gaming is a next-generation Universal Blue atomic image built on Fedora Kinoite (KDE) to deliver a powerful all-in-one gaming workstation. It combines a developer-centric OS, comprehensive gaming tools, AI/ML capabilities, penetration testing suites, cloud-native utilities, and aggressive performance optimizations into a single immutable image.

## AuroraMax GameHack: Project Instructions for Claude ... üìù

Hello! Your task is to assist in the generation of scripts, configuration files, and documentation for the **AuroraMax GameHack** Linux distribution project. You will reference a series of previously generated specification documents. Your goal is to translate these specifications into tangible artifacts.

## Key Information
- Based on Universal Blue (which itself is based on Fedora Atomic/Silverblue)
- Immutable/image-based operating system
- Gaming-focused customizations and optimizations
- Uses rpm-ostree for system management

## Further Instructions for Claude
- Follow Universal Blue best practices for custom images
- Use Containerfile/Dockerfile for image customization
- Ensure all modifications are compatible with rpm-ostree and immutable system design

## Core Objective

To create the necessary build scripts (`Containerfile`, `build.sh`), configuration files (for system settings, `ujust` commands), and supporting documentation (like detailed package manifests for each variant) based on the provided project design.

## I. Understanding the Project Workflow and Structure

**Primary Reference:** `auroramax_project_overview`

* **Action:** Familiarize yourself with the four main development phases:
    1.  **Initialization (7 Init Variants)**
    2.  **Synthesis I (SemiFinal Variant)**
    3.  **LLM-Driven Refinement (3 Recommend Variants)**
    4.  **Synthesis II & Finalization (Release Candidate)**
* **Key Takeaway:** Your generation tasks will often be specific to one of these variants or phases. The project is iterative, meaning configurations and scripts for later variants will build upon or synthesize elements from earlier ones.
* **Diagrams:** The diagrams described in this document (Overall Workflow, Variant Development Flow, Build Pipeline) provide a visual map of the project. Use them to understand how different components and stages relate.

## II. Generating Build Artifacts for "Init" Variants

**Primary References:**
* `auroramax_init_variants` (for specific features and philosophy of each of the 7 Init variants)
* `auroramax_package_lists_v1` (for comprehensive package names)
* `auroramax_system_config_v1` (for performance and optimization settings)
* `auroramax_build_github` (for `Containerfile` and `build.sh` structure, and where to place files)

* **Task:** For each of the seven "Init" variants described in `auroramax_init_variants`:
    1.  **Create a `Containerfile`:**
        * Start from the base image: `ghcr.io/ublue-os/kinoite-main:latest` (or a specified Fedora version like `:42`).
        * Include steps to copy a dedicated `build.sh` script and a `files/` directory for that variant.
        * Add RPM Fusion and other necessary repositories as outlined in `auroramax_build_github` and the "AuroraMax Gaming" seed document.
        * End with `RUN ostree container commit`.
    2.  **Create a `build.sh` script:**
        * This script will perform the actual customization.
        * **Package Installation:**
            * Refer to `auroramax_init_variants` for the *specific focus* and *intended toolset* of the current variant (e.g., for `Init-GamingFocused`, heavily draw from the "AuroraMax Gaming" seed document and the gaming sections of `auroramax_package_lists_v1`).
            * For `Init-DevFocused` and `Init-HackingFocused`, use their respective sections in `auroramax_init_variants` and the detailed package lists.
            * For general Init variants (Minimal, Stable, CuttingEdge, UX), select packages appropriately based on their philosophy, using `auroramax_package_lists_v1` as your master list.
            * Include commands like `dnf install -y ...` for RPMs.
            * For Python modules specified in `auroramax_package_lists_v1` (e.g., AI/ML tools), include `pip3 install --no-cache-dir ...` commands. Be mindful of whether these should be in the base image or suggested for toolboxes. Prioritize base image inclusion for core functionality of the variant.
        * **Configuration File Placement:**
            * Identify relevant configurations from `auroramax_system_config_v1` (e.g., sysctl settings, udev rules).
            * Create snippets for these (e.g., `99-auroramax.conf` for sysctl, `60-io-scheduler.rules` for udev) and ensure `build.sh` copies them from a `files/` directory into the correct system paths (e.g., `/etc/sysctl.d/`, `/etc/udev/rules.d/`).
            * The `Init-General-Minimal` variant should have the fewest custom configurations, while specialized variants like `Init-GamingFocused` will have more.
        * **Systemd Service Enablement:**
            * Enable services mentioned in `auroramax_system_config_v1` (e.g., `duperemove.service`, `rmlint.timer`, `zram-generator.service`) using `ln -sf ...` commands in `build.sh`.
        * **Kernel Arguments:**
            * Apply relevant kernel arguments from `auroramax_system_config_v1` using `rpm-ostree kargs --append="..."`.
    3.  **Populate `files/` directory:**
        * This directory (e.g., `variants/init-gaming/files/`) will contain the actual config snippets (sysctl, udev, modprobe, skel files, `justfiles`) that `build.sh` copies into the image. Generate these small text files based on `auroramax_system_config_v1` and variant-specific needs.
        * For `ujust` commands, create `justfile` snippets (e.g., `gaming.just`, `developer.just`) based on suggestions in `auroramax_system_config_v1` and relevant variant specifications. These will be placed in `/usr/share/justfiles/` within the image.
    4.  **Flatpak Integration (First Boot):**
        * Flatpaks listed in `auroramax_package_lists_v1` are generally installed on first boot or by user invocation.
        * Your `build.sh` might include adding Flathub remote.
        * A first-boot script (e.g., `auroramax-firstboot.sh`, copied into the image and run by a systemd service) could be generated to install a core set of Flatpaks relevant to the variant's purpose.

* **Location:** Generated files should follow the structure outlined in `auroramax_build_github` (e.g., within `variants/init-gaming/`).

---

## III. Assisting with Synthesis Phases (Conceptual Script Merging)

**Primary References:**
* `auroramax_synthesis_llm_qa` (for understanding the synthesis strategy)
* The `Containerfile` and `build.sh` scripts generated for the Init variants.

* **Task (Conceptual for `SemiFinal` and `ReleaseCandidate`):**
    * While you might not perform the full synthesis logic, you may be asked to:
        * **Merge Package Lists:** Given selections from multiple Init variants, generate a combined package list for `SemiFinal`'s `build.sh`.
        * **Combine Configurations:** Identify and merge sysctl settings, udev rules, or kernel arguments from different variants, resolving conflicts based on a "prioritize performance and stability" heuristic or specific instructions.
        * **Integrate `justfiles`:** Combine `justfile` snippets from multiple variants into a more comprehensive set for `SemiFinal` or `ReleaseCandidate`.
    * **Example:** If `Init-GamingFocused` has specific kernel arguments for low latency, and `Init-DevFocused` has arguments for enabling certain virtualization features, the `SemiFinal` `build.sh` would need to include both sets, if compatible.

---

## IV. Incorporating LLM Feedback (Conceptual)

**Primary Reference:** `auroramax_synthesis_llm_qa` (LLM Integration Plan)

* **Task:** If provided with hypothetical LLM recommendations (e.g., "LLM suggests adding package X for better security" or "LLM recommends sysctl parameter Y for network performance"), you may be asked to:
    * Modify an existing `build.sh` (e.g., for `SemiFinal`) to include these new packages or configurations, thus creating a basis for one of the "Recommend" variants.

---

## V. Generating Supporting Documentation and Configuration Snippets

**Primary References:** All documents, as needed.

* **Task:**
    1.  **Detailed Package Manifests:** For each generated `build.sh`, also output a separate markdown file listing all RPMs, Flatpaks (intended for first boot or `ujust` install), and Python modules included in that specific variant. This aids transparency.
    2.  **Configuration Snippets:** Generate the content of individual configuration files (e.g., `/tmp/files/99-sysctl-auroramax.conf` in the build context) based on `auroramax_system_config_v1`.
    3.  **`ujust` File Content:** Based on the desired `ujust` commands mentioned in `auroramax_system_config_v1` and variant-specific needs (e.g., `ujust install-emudeck` for gaming), generate the content for the `justfile`s. Example structure:
        ```just
        # Install EmuDeck
        install-emudeck:
            #!/bin/bash
            set -euxo pipefail
            echo "Fetching and running EmuDeck installer..."
            # (Commands to download and run EmuDeck installer script)
        ```
    4.  **README.md Updates:** You might be asked to contribute sections to the main `README.md` (template in `auroramax_build_github`) detailing features specific to a variant being worked on.

---

## VI. Adhering to Quality and Testing Context

**Primary References:**
* `auroramax_benchmarking_testing_v1`
* `auroramax_synthesis_llm_qa` (QA Plan)

* **Action:** While you are not executing tests, understand that all generated scripts and configurations are intended to produce a high-quality, performant, and stable distribution.
* **Key Takeaway:** When generating configurations, prioritize settings known for stability and performance as detailed in `auroramax_system_config_v1`. Avoid experimental settings unless explicitly requested for a "CuttingEdge" type variant.
* If a configuration has known trade-offs (e.g., `mitigations=off`), ensure comments are included in the generated scripts or configuration files indicating this, as per security best practices.

---

## General Instructions for Generation:

* **Idempotency:** Where possible, commands in `build.sh` should be idempotent (running them multiple times doesn't have adverse effects). `dnf install -y` is generally fine. File copying should use options to overwrite if necessary (e.g., `install -D -m644 ...`).
* **Error Handling:** `build.sh` scripts should typically start with `set -euxo pipefail` to catch errors.
* **Comments:** Add comments to `Containerfile` and `build.sh` to explain non-obvious steps or choices, especially when selecting specific packages or configurations for a variant.
* **Clarity:** Generated file content should be clear, well-formatted, and directly reflect the specifications.
* **Placeholder Awareness:** The GitHub organization (`your-org`) and specific tags (`:latest`, `:42`) are placeholders. Use them as provided, or be prepared to parameterize them if instructed.

By following these instructions and referencing the provided documents carefully, you will be instrumental in laying the groundwork for AuroraMax GameHack.
